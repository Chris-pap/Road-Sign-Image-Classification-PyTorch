# Road Sign Image Classification | PyTorch

### Use your own image
Use one image with **one** road sign and the least background you can for the best results.

### Overview
#### Version: 0.1
Our PyTorch model for road sign image classification has been trained using transfer learning on the MobileNetV3 architecture, leveraging the pre-trained weights to achieve high accuracy and efficiency. The model has been trained on a dataset of 24,000 images that span across 43 different classes of road signs, allowing for accurate classification of a wide range of sign types. Our model achieved 99% accuracy during training.

Furthermore, the PyTorch framework enables flexibility and customization in the model architecture, making it easy to fine-tune the model for specific use cases. This means that the model can be adapted to work with different types of road signs or different regions, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of applications.

Road Signs our model supports:

‘Speed limit (80km/h)’,  
‘End of speed limit (80km/h)’,  
‘Speed limit (100km/h)’,  
‘Speed limit (120km/h)’,  
‘No passing’,  
‘No passing for vehicles over 3.5 metric tons’,  
‘Right-of-way at the next intersection’,
